# Pang
I choose extra credit 2,3
1 was not chosen becuase what MVC is look to solve I handle in diffrent manner, that is separation of concerns and mediator pattern.
I like to think first about the problem, which is making a pang game, then architecture which may or may not be like MVC. 
I did not want to focus on how can I make it the MVC way.
MVC does not fit Unity and games in general, it mainly used for UI work in ecosystems where it is common to change UI/rendering framworks, it is unlike for a Unity project to make such drastic change.
I did not choose 4 as doiing would not prove I am capable programmer.
I did not do 5 becuase split screen does not work well on mobile and same reason as 4.
6 I just did not want to waste time on.
